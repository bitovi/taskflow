# TaskFlow — AI Feature Generation Demo

A modern task management app built with Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, and Prisma. TaskFlow provides a comprehensive solution for managing tasks, and projects with an intuitive drag-and-drop Kanban board interface.

This repository is intentionally structured as a demo and sandbox for Bitovi's AI workflows:
- Understanding a codebase and generating copilot instructions
- Automatically implementing features from a Jira ticket

Reference materials:
- [Instruction generation](https://github.com/bitovi/ai-enablement-prompts/tree/main/understanding-code/instruction-generation) workflow
- [Feature generation](https://github.com/bitovi/ai-enablement-prompts/tree/main/writing-code/generate-feature) workflow 
- Example [Jira ticket](https://bitovi-training.atlassian.net/browse/USER-13) used in this repo
- [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/TvHxpQ3z4Zq5JWOVUkgLlU/Tasks-Search-and-Filter?m=auto&t=ehht6F82l82y3XIW-6)

## What you’ll do in this demo

- Run the app locally with seeded sample data
- Explore the baseline experience on the `main` branch
- Review the AI-completed feature for USER-13 on the `user-13-search-and-filter` branch
- Compare branches and see exactly what the AI changed
- Optionally, follow the Bitovi workflows to reproduce the feature implementation with your own AI agent

## Tech overview

- Next.js 14 App Router, React, TypeScript
- Prisma ORM with SQLite for local development
- shadcn/ui + Radix + Tailwind for UI
- Feature-based structure with server actions and typed components

## Installation

Taskflow requires Node.JS version 18 or greater

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitovi/taskflow
   cd taskflow
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the database
   ```bash
   # Create, migrate and populate the database
   npm run db:setup
   ```
   This will create sample users and tasks for testing. Default login credentials:
   - Email: `alice@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:3000

## Branches used in this demo

- main
  - Baseline application used as the starting point for AI feature work
  - Visit /tasks to see the tasks page before the feature is implemented

- user-13-search-and-filter
  - Contains the implementation of Jira ticket USER-13
  - Adds a searchable task bar and filter controls to the /tasks page
  - Follows the project’s patterns (server actions, Prisma, shadcn/ui, accessibility)

Common Git operations for exploring the demo:
```bash
# Fetch all branches
git fetch --all

# Switch between the baseline and AI-implemented feature
git switch main
git switch user-13-search-and-filter

# See what changed between branches
git diff main...user-13-search-and-filter
```

## The AI-implemented feature (USER-13)

Ticket: https://bitovi-training.atlassian.net/browse/USER-13

Feature summary:
- Adds a searchable input and filters on the /tasks page
- Lets users quickly find tasks by text, priority, and status

How to try it:
1. Start the app (see Installation above)
2. Log in with the seeded account or create your own 
   - (alice@example.com / password123)
3. On `main`, navigate to /tasks and note the baseline behavior
4. Switch to `user-13-search-and-filter` and refresh /tasks
5. Try searching by task title/description and filtering by priority/status

## Tutorial: Running the AI workflows yourself

If you want to recreate the experience with your own AI agent, follow the Bitovi guides:

1) Instruction generation
- Goal: produce a codebase-specific instruction file the AI will follow when writing code
- Guide: https://github.com/bitovi/ai-enablement-prompts/tree/main/understanding-code/instruction-generation

2) Feature generation
- Goal: point your AI at a Jira ticket (e.g., USER-13) and have it implement the feature
- Guide: https://github.com/bitovi/ai-enablement-prompts/tree/main/writing-code/generate-feature

Suggested flow:
- Start on `main`
- Provide your agent with the instruction generation prompt to build a coding conventions file
- Provide your agent with the feature generation prompt and the USER-13 ticket
- Let the agent create a feature branch and implement the change
- Compare your branch to `user-13-search-and-filter` to see how close you match

## Database management

Available scripts:
- `npm run db:seed` — Populate the database with sample data
- `npm run db:clear` — Clear all data from the database
- `npm run db:reset` — Clear and re-seed the database

The seed script creates:
- 7 sample users with different roles and profiles
- 30+ sample tasks with various priorities, statuses, and assignments
- Realistic task data including descriptions, due dates, and assignments

Local development database:
- Uses SQLite via Prisma (see `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Seeded data is safe to reset at any time using the scripts above
