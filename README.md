#### Server Actions (app/(dashboard)/tasks/actions.ts)
```typescript
// Example: Server-side data fetching
export async function getAllTasks() {
  try {
    const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
      include: { assignee: true, creator: true }
    })
    return { tasks, error: null }
  } catch (error) {
    return { tasks: null, error: 'Failed to fetch tasks' }
  }
}
```

#### Component Structure

- **Client Components**: Use "use client" for interactivity
- **shadcn/ui**: Consistent component library with Tailwind styling

#### Type Safety
- All database operations use Prisma-generated types
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Interface definitions in `lib/types.ts`

### Debugging Tips

- **Database Issues**: Check `app.db` SQLite file exists and has correct permissions
- **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes
- **UI Components**: Use browser dev tools to inspect Tailwind classes
- **Server Actions**: Check terminal output for server-side errors

## 🗄 Database Management

### Schema Overview
The application uses SQLite with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations:

```sql
-- Core tables
Users (id, email, password, name)
Tasks (id, name, description, priority, status, dueDate, assigneeId, creatorId)
Sessions (id, token, userId) -- for authentication
```

### Available Scripts

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `npm run db:setup` | **Full setup** - Create DB, migrate, seed | Initial setup, clean slate |
| `npm run db:seed` | **Add sample data** | Need more test data |
| `npm run db:clear` | **Remove all data** | Clean database, keep structure |
| `npm run db:reset` | **Clear + re-seed** | Fresh data for testing |

### Sample Data Details

#### 👥 Users (7 total)
- **alice@example.com** - Primary test account (password: `password123`)
- **bob@example.com** through **george@example.com** - Additional team members
- All users have the same password for easy testing

#### 📋 Tasks (30+ total)
- **Priorities**: Distributed across High, Medium, Low
- **Statuses**: Todo (3), In Progress (9), Review (9), Done (9)
- **Assignments**: 80% have assignees, 20% unassigned
- **Due Dates**: 70% have due dates, varied time ranges
- **Realistic Content**: Task names and descriptions mirror real development work

#### 🔑 Sessions (3 active)
- Pre-created sessions for testing login persistence
- Sessions tied to different users for multi-user testing

### Database Schema Management

```bash
# View current schema
cat prisma/schema.prisma

# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Create migration (if using migrations instead of db push)
npx prisma migrate dev --name your-migration-name

# View data in browser (launches Prisma Studio)
npx prisma studio
```

### Production Considerations
- **SQLite** is suitable for demos and small applications
- For production, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Update `prisma/schema.prisma` datasource for other databases
- Environment variables for database URLs

- Environment variables for database URLs
