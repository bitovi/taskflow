# Tech Stack Analysis - TaskFlow

## Core Technology Analysis

**Programming language(s):**
- TypeScript (primary language for all application code)
- JavaScript (for Prisma scripts: seed.js, clear.js)

**Primary framework:**
- Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router architecture
- React 19.1.0 as the UI library

**Secondary or tertiary frameworks:**
- Prisma 6.13.0 as the ORM and database toolkit
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Radix UI components (@radix-ui/*) for accessible UI primitives
- Recharts 3.1.2 for data visualization
- Hello-Pangea DnD 18.0.1 for drag-and-drop functionality

**State management approach:**
- React Server Components for server-side data fetching
- Server Actions for data mutations
- Local component state with React hooks
- No global state management library (Redux, Zustand, etc.)

**Other relevant technologies or patterns:**
- SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- date-fns for date manipulation
- Lucide React for icons
- class-variance-authority for conditional CSS classes
- ESLint for code linting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## Domain Specificity Analysis

**What specific problem domain does this application target?**
Task management and project collaboration platform. It's a comprehensive task tracking system that enables teams to organize, assign, prioritize, and monitor work items through multiple views (list, kanban board).

**What are the core business concepts?**
- **Task Management**: Creation, assignment, status tracking, priority management
- **User Management**: Authentication, user profiles, task assignment
- **Project Organization**: Task categorization, status workflows, due date management
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user task assignment, progress tracking
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Task statistics, progress visualization, team performance metrics

**What type of user interactions does it support?**
- **Authentication workflows**: Login, signup, session management
- **Task CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Task status management**: Toggle completion, update progress states
- **Assignment workflows**: Assign tasks to team members
- **Visual organization**: Drag-and-drop kanban board interface
- **Dashboard monitoring**: View statistics and charts
- **Team management**: User administration and team overview

**What are the primary data types and structures used?**
- **User entities**: id, email, password, name, sessions, task relationships
- **Task entities**: id, name, description, priority (low/medium/high), status (todo/in_progress/done/review), dueDate, assignee/creator relationships, timestamps
- **Session entities**: id, token, user relationship, timestamps
- **Relational data**: User-to-Task many-to-many relationships for creators and assignees

## Application Boundaries

**What features/functionality are clearly within scope based on existing code?**
- Task creation, editing, deletion, and status management
- User authentication and session management
- Task assignment to team members
- Multiple task views (list view, kanban board)
- Dashboard with analytics and charts
- Task prioritization and due date management
- Team member overview and statistics
- Drag-and-drop task organization

**What types of features would be architecturally inconsistent with the current design?**
- Real-time collaboration features (no WebSocket infrastructure)
- File upload/attachment systems (no file storage integration)
- Advanced permission systems (current auth is basic session-based)
- Multi-project/workspace organization (single-database, flat task structure)
- Third-party integrations (no API infrastructure for external services)
- Advanced reporting/analytics (beyond basic charts)
- Notification systems (no background job processing)

**Are there any specialized libraries or mathematical concepts that suggest domain constraints?**
- Recharts suggests the system is designed for basic data visualization and reporting
- Hello-Pangea DnD indicates drag-and-drop interfaces are a core interaction pattern
- Prisma ORM suggests relational data modeling is preferred over document-based approaches
- SQLite database indicates single-instance deployment rather than distributed systems
- Server Actions pattern suggests form-based interactions rather than real-time updates
