# Dependency Lock Style Guide

## Unique Patterns in TaskFlow

### Lock File Management
- Uses `package-lock.json` (npm) rather than yarn.lock or pnpm-lock.yaml
- Lock file includes integrity hashes for security
- Exact dependency resolution for consistent builds

### Version Strategy
- Next.js and React versions are locked to specific versions
- TypeScript and tooling dependencies use compatible ranges
- Prisma client and CLI versions match exactly

### Node Version Requirement
Package.json specifies Node.js version requirement:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "^20"
}
```

### Lock File Characteristics
- Generated by npm 10.x
- Includes resolved URLs and integrity hashes
- Maintains dependency tree for reproducible builds
- Includes both production and development dependencies

### Security Considerations
- Lock file should be committed to repository
- Regular updates through `npm audit` and `npm update`
- Dependency integrity verification during install

### Best Practices for TaskFlow
- Never manually edit package-lock.json
- Use `npm ci` for production builds
- Commit lock file changes with dependency updates
- Review lock file changes during code review
